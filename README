This is screen state tests for weblocks.

Screen state test is kind of test.
We capture screenshots on different web application states (after going to some page or clicking some link, button etc.).
During test runs new screenshots are captured and compared with saved ones. 
When generated screenshot has some differences from old screenshot exception is thrown.

In this repository test screenshots are saved. 

To use tests you need to ...

1. Set up environment. 

Start weblocks-selenium-tests with command start-full-tests-server. start-full-tests-server needs to be linked in weblocks-selenium-tests directory for this. And all packages from script should be installed.

2. Set up weblocks-selenium-tests configuration. 

weblocks-selenium-tests variable *screen-state-tests-dir* should point to weblocks-screen-state-tests directory. You can either change variable or link weblocks-screen-state-tests directory to weblocks-selenium-tests/screen-tests.

Configuration variable *do-screen-state-tests* should be true.

You should use firefox for testing (*selenium-browser* variable should be same as *selenium-firefox-browser*)
